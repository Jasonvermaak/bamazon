Bamazon

Shopping for your everyday needs.

Bamazon is a unique webstore application that combines node.js with mysql for the best shopping experience.

All the user must do is download the neccessary npm packages, open up the terminal command line and make their own mysql data base.

After that, simply open up the terminal, follow the prompts and select which products interest you.

The user will be shown all products including name, current stock and prices.

Bamazon is smart and will not allow the user to purchase more than what is currently in stock of any given product.

After selecting a product ID and entering a quantity, Bamazon will inform the user if the sale went through or not.
